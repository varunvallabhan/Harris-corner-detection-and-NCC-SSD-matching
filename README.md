# Harris-corner-detection-and-NCC-SSD-matching
Finding the Harris corners to get the interest point and matching them with images of the same object from different angles or orientation using SSD or NCC
provide two images for corner detection. It would be better if the image resolution is reduces as the script takes some time to run in case of UHD or HD images.
functions are provided for harris corner, ssd, and ncc.
The threshold can be varied to increase more point/lines in the image
